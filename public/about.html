<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello, my name is Andrei and I am 19 years old. This year I started working again because I finished the 12th grade, and now on vacation I need relaxation. I am a boy who likes to joke and feel good, I have many friends and I like to do sports, go outside and play on the computer. Another passion of mine is mathematics, which is why I managed to get a grade 10 in mathematics this year and enter the faculty of mathematics and informatics.</p>

<p>I am a direct person and always on the subject, so I don't like it to talk a lot and pointlessly. I consider myself a good boy, with a lot of good sense and a nice character. I am a sociable and friendly person by nature and I always liked to make many friends. In my spare time, I usually play my favorite game, which is SA-MP, go out with my friends, watch series or YouTube, do sports and socialize with the world.</p>

<p>I really like to do sports and I have been playing performance handball for 8 years. I love this sport and have many achievements, both collective and personal. To be honest, I love all sports and I could not see my life without sports.</p>
